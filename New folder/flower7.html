        <b>Origin of Pink Carnation</b>
        <br><br> 
        The pink carnation is believed to have originated from the Mediterranean region. Carnations, in general, 
        have a long history and have been cultivated for over 2,000 years. They are native to Eurasia, but their 
        exact origin is often traced to the Mediterranean area, where they were first appreciated for their 
        beauty and fragrance.
