        <b>Origin of Pink Roses</b>
        <br><br> 
        Historical records suggest that the cultivation of roses began in Asia, particularly in China, several 
        thousand years ago. From there, roses spread to other parts of the world through trade and exploration. 
        Pink roses have been cherished for their beauty and fragrance for centuries and have become a staple 
        in gardens and floral arrangements globally.

        <b>Origin of Red Roses</b>
        <br><br> 
        Roses are believed to have originated in Asia around 35 million years ago. They were first cultivated in 
        ancient China and then spread to the Middle East and Europe through trade routes. By the time of the 
        Roman Empire, roses were widely grown and appreciated across Europe.

        <b>Origin of Lavender Roses</b>
        <br><br> 
        Lavender-colored roses are a relatively recent development in the history of rose cultivation, primarily 
        created through hybridization efforts in the late 20th century. These roses are the result of 
        crossbreeding between various rose species to achieve the unique lavender hue. Their origin can be 
        traced back to modern rose breeding programs in Europe and the United States.
