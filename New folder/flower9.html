        <br><br>
        <b>Origin of Rose Carnation</b>
        <br><br> 
        Roses are primarily native to Asia, with some species originating in Europe, North America, and 
        Northwest Africa. Carnations, scientifically known as Dianthus caryophyllus, are native to the 
        Mediterranean region and have been cultivated forover 2,000 years. Both flowers have spread 
        globally, becoming essential elements in floral arrangements.
        <br><br>
        <b>Origin of Limonium</b>
        <br><br> 
        Limonium, commonly known as statice or sea lavender, originates from the Mediterranean region, including 
        parts of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It thrives in coastal areas and salt marshes. Known for its 
        long-lasting blooms, Limonium is widely used in both fresh and dried floral arrangements.
